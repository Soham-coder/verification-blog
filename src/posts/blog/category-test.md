## Verilog famous questions

```md

Q1: Difference b/w blocking and non-blocking statements 
---
```
```cpp
//Example1
module blocking_ff(clk, a, b);

input clk;
input a;
output b;
reg c;
always_ff@(posedge clk)
begin
 c = a; //RHS will be evaluated in active region and LHS will be updated in active region. So c will get value a as well as b will also get value c sequentially but change of values will be reflected then and there in active region only. Their values will get reflected if printed by system task $display or $strobe. It will synthesize to only 1 flip-flop with a as input and b=c as output wire with "clk" as clock of the flip-flop
 b = c;
end
endmodule
```
```
In first case, blocking assignments are used and hence the value of a will be assigned to c and the new value will be reflected onto b in same cycle and hence the variable c and b results in a wire. So, only one flip flop will be needed.
```
```cpp
//Example1
module non_blocking_ff(clk, a, b);

input clk;
input a;
output b;
reg c;
always_ff@(posedge clk)
begin
 c <= a;//RHS will be evaluated in active region and LHS will be updated in NBA region. So c will get value of a, and b will get value of c
 //Their values will be reflected if they are printed by system task $strobe which occurs at the NBA region. 
 //It will synthesize to 2 f/fs - 1st flop with i/p as a and o/p as c
 //2nd flop with i/p as c and o/p as b, both clocked by the same clock "clk"
 b <= c; 
 //This is also the way for addition of pipeline registers where we put registers or f/fs in critical path i.e., longest combinational loop to break it down into shorter sequential paths
end
endmodule
```
```
In second case, old value of c is sampled before the new value is reflected in each cycle. Hence value of a reflects to b only in 2 cycles, resulting in two flip-flops.
```
```cpp
//Example2
module blocking_ff(clk, a, b, z);

input clk;
input a,b;
output z;
reg x,y;
always_ff@(posedge clk)
begin
 x = a|b;
 y = a&b;
 z = x|y;
end
```
```
In this example, each statement uses blocking assignments and the values of a and b are evaluated and assigned to x and y immediately as the statements execute in order. Hence, in third statement, the new values of x and y are evaluated and assigned to z.

Thus blocking statement are executed in the active region of Verilog Stratified Event Queue.
```
```cpp
//Example2
module non_blocking_ff(clk, a, b, z);

input clk;
input a,b;
output z;
reg x,y;
always_ff@(posedge clk)
begin
 x <= a|b;
 y <= a&b;
 z <= x|y;
end
endmodule
```
```
In nonblocking assignments, all assignments are deferred until end of current simulation tick. Hence, evaluation of entire RHS (Right hand side) happens first and only then assignment to LHS happens.

In this example, the RHS of each of the three statements are evaluated first and only after that the assignments to each of LHS (Left hand side) happens. Hence, you can notice that in this case, the old values of x and y are ORâ€™ed and assigned to z.

Thus evaluation of RHS of Nonblocking statement occurred in Active Region and updation of LHS side happen in NBA region.

Q2: Frequency divider or clock divider by 2
---
```

```md
For the circuit-

We make a flip-flop with input d and output q and ~q clocked by clock "clk"
The input clk needs to be divided by 2 , So if you connect output ~q with input d then the normal output q will act as your divided_by_2 clock
```
```cpp
module freq_divider_by_2(rst, clk, clk_by_2);

input rst;
input clk;
output reg clk_by_2;

//q = clk_by_2
//~q = ~clk_by_2

always_ff@(posedge clk)
begin
if(rst)//high active rst (say)
clk_by_2 <= 1'b0;
else
clk_by_2 <= ~clk_by_2; //connect the q~ to d
end

endmodule
```

Q3: Draw a state machine for a sequence detector which can detect the pattern 1010 [01*] 0111

Here [01*] means that any number of 0s followed by any number of 1s
eg., 00..1, 0111.., 01, 001, 011, 1, 1.., 11 etc.,

*Disclaimer- I have not faced this type of question before where sequence can be multiple combinations - So please do point out if you see any flaw or states that have not been considered*
*Error Note- In figure below, transition should be from S8 to --> S2 (0/0) !!!*
```

Q4: Why there is no XNAND or XAND gates when there is XNOR or XOR gates

**Disclaimer-This is the one of the weirdest question I have faced ever. I seriously don't know the answer, and also don't want to know. Though if you find the right answer, ping me the answer. For now I am giving the answer which I found in the internet** 

```
```md
XOR is synonymous to XNAND
XNOR is synomymous to XAND

So these gates are redundant as is this question :)
```
