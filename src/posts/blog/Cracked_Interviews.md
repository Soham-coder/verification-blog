Up Until now I cracked the following interviews which I experienced during my professional journey.
Each of them were very unique and provided me an enriching knowledgeable experience.

The companies and the roles I converted are the following:-

AMD - Silicon Design Engineer-2
Qualcomm - Senior Engineer(CPU Verification)
Western Digital - System Design Engineer(NAND)
Micron - Senior ASIC DV Engineer
Marvell Semiconductor - Staff Verification Engineer
Synopsys - Application Engineer 2 and ASIC Digital Design Engineer 2


APT Portfolio (HFT Firm based out of New Delhi) - Hardware Engineer 
This is one of the toughest interviews I faced
